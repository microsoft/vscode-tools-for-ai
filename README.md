# Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code
Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code, previously called Visual Studio Code Tools for AI**, is an extension to easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models to the cloud or the edge with [Azure Machine Learning service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/).

With Azure Machine Learning service, you can:
- Build and train machine learning models faster, and easily deploy to the cloud or the edge.
- Use the latest open source technologies such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), or Jupyter.
- Experiment locally and then quickly scale up or out with large GPU-enabled clusters in the cloud.
- Speed up data science with automated machine learning and hyper-parameter tuning.
- Track your experiments, manage models, and easily deploy with integrated CI/CD tooling.

** Previous documentation and vsix installer have been moved to the [archive](/archive) folder.
